Hi there, I’m Lorence Baldesco 👋

ABOUT ME
I am a Computer Engineering student interested in learning and grasping all the technologies around me. 
I am eager to provide a lot of ideas to everyone around me. I am not just a boy, but a man who loves technology.
I wanted to build a new technology in front of everyone.

👀 I’m interested in 
Cybersecurity and UI/UX design. Blast OFF!!!

🌱 I’m currently learning 
basic frond-end development coz I am from STEM and I never learn ICT staff.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
Cybersecurity things and UI/UX Design, but it's better if you have a challenge for me!
